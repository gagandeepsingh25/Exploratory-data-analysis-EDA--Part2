Methods of Exploratory Data Analysis
It is always better to explore each data set using multiple exploratory techniques and compare the results. Once the data set is fully understood, it is quite possible that data scientist will have to go back to data collection and cleansing phases in order to transform the data set according to the desired business outcomes. The goal of this step is to become confident that the data set is ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm.

Exploratory Data Analysis is majorly performed using the following methods:

Univariate visualization — provides summary statistics for each field in the raw data set
Bivariate visualization — is performed to find the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable of interest
Multivariate visualization — is performed to understand interactions between different fields in the dataset
Dimensionality reduction — helps to understand the fields in the data that account for the most variance between observations and allow for the processing of a reduced volume of data. Through these methods, the data scientist validates assumptions and identifies patterns that will allow for the understanding of the problem and model selection and validates that the data has been generated in the way it was expected to. So, value distribution of each field is checked, a number of missing values is defined, and the possible ways of replacing them are found.
Additional benefits Exploratory Data Analysis brings to projects Another side benefit of EDA is that it allows to specify or even define the questions you are trying to get the answer to from your data. Companies, that are only starting to leverage Data Science and AI technologies, often face the situation when they realize, that they have a lot of data and no ideas of what value that data can bring to their business decision making.

However, the questions always come first in data analysis. It doesn’t matter how much data company has, how many tools they have available, whether the data is historical or real time unless business stakeholders have the questions they are trying to solve with their data. EDA can help such companies to start formalizing the right questions, since with wrong questions you get the wrong answers, and take the wrong decisions.

There are a lot of ways to reach these goals as follows:

Import the data

Get a feel of the data ,describe the data,look at a sample of data like first and last rows

Take a deeper look into the data by querying or indexing the data

Identify features of interest

Recognise the challenges posed by data - missing values, outliers

Discover patterns in the data
